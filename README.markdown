**w2a-teatimer** is a simple tea timer, which I built as a quick-and-dirty web app, and then ported to the iPhone and the Android.

This was intended to be part of a series of example apps, written along with tutorials. After letting it sit for a week, I decided to release it in this early stage. I may get back to it soon; I may not.

## Features

* Allows user to select a kind of tea (green or black).
* Counts down from two minutes for green tea and five minutes for black tea.
* Can be restarted simply by tapping or clicking a button.
* Hasn't crashed on me on any platform.

## Issues

* The code isn't very clean. The timer is especially messy.
* There are no unit tests.

## TODO

* Add an animation to show time running out. I was thinking an arc about 30 pixels wide that animates from being a full circle and diminishes along with the time until it disappears.
* Do the web programming so it looks right on a mobile web device.
