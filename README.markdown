**w2a-teatimer** is a simple tea timer, which I built as a quick-and-dirty web app, and then ported to the iPhone and the Android.

Here's the web app: [Tea Timer](http://code.benatkin.com/w2a-teatimer/)

I last built the native mobile apps in July 2010. I haven't yet verifified that the iPhone and Android versions still work.

## Features

* Allows user to select a kind of tea (green or black).
* Counts down from two minutes for green tea and five minutes for black tea.
* Can be restarted simply by tapping or clicking a button.
* Hasn't crashed on me on any platform.

## TODO

* Add an animation to show time running out. I was thinking an arc about 30 pixels wide that animates from being a full circle and diminishes along with the time until it disappears.
* Do the web programming so it looks right on a mobile web device.
